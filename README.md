#Final project of Technigo boot camp part 1#

This is the final project of the first part of the Technigo fall 2019 part time boot camp **beginner level.** The boot camp has lasted for 10 weeks and have covered HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The course plan has also included knowledge about the tech industry, how to work in a tech team, guest lecturers on relevant topics, including personal development. It is a fast pace program with a schedule of building one project per week. The projects were built individually, in pair programming and with mob programming.

The objective for this final project was to practice and apply all parts included in the course plan. The requirements were: 
* Use a public API
* Manipulate/modify the data (search functionality, filtering etc)
* Use semantic HTML tags
* Responsive
* Mobile first
* Cross browser compatibility
* Accessibility
* Should be deployed on Netlify
* Follow code guide lines

I choose to use an API from Spotify â€“ Audio Features & Analysis. It turned ut that the authentification was complicated, so I ended up deriving data from the API and storing it in my project instead. I used the data to create 4 different category playlists based on 4 "mode" categories, to learn more about how Spotify evaluates the songs compared to my own perception. I picked tracks randomly and checked their values. If I had more time I would create graphs for each song with the values I've chosen, and do some more research.

I have used CSS keyframes for animations, JavaScript toggle function to show/hide playlists, sorting, randomizing, and show/hide overlay. Things to fix that I couldn't figure out just yet:
* Transition on playlist
* Black background in html, without disabling the overlay on body bg image
* Overflow scroll on overlay text
* Pointer cursor, not working
* Finetune responsiveness
